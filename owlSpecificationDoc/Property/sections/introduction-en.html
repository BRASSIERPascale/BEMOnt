Complementing the sensor representation of the building devices and infrastructure, the phenomenon (or property) representation provides a common vision about the general characteristics to be considered in the building. Thus, one of the extensions of the ontology appears in the ssn:Property representation. Two main families of characteristics were considered: economic and physical properties.

## Economic Properties

The Economic phenomena makes reference to all monetary and investment aspects that could affect the building domains. For example, this part of the ontology allows one to represent water-related prices, energy bills, building investments, etc. These specific phenomena has been subdivided into:

- Costs to capture the investment costs of the building; and
- Investment to represent the building investment aspects and information.

## Physic Properties

Physical properties represent all related physical aspects that can be observed: dimensional, volumetric, and radiation aspects that influence the building and occupant behaviour. These phenomena support the alignment and fusion of specific observations based on general measurements (e.g. temperature, volume, etc.).
