 This semantic model is focused on describing the general model referring the occupant behaviour. In that sense and according with (Hong et.al,2015), the occupant behaviour is composed by the following main aspects:

- Drivers: Represent discrete-event simulation models for modeling occupant behavior, activities, events, and equipments, considering the factors that stimulates occupants to accomplish their needs.
- Needs: Model the requirements that the different occupants shall meet to ensure their satisfaction in the environment which interacts.
- Actions: Model the occupants interactions with the building to achieve the required comfort.

Considering these three main aspects, the constructed semantic model relies on the combination of the Drivers, Needs, and Actions with the representation of the building infrastructure (aligning the model with the IFC) and the different observations that could occur in the building (SSN ontology)
