# Occupant Behaviour Modelling

## Introduction and Overall Overview of the Occupant Behaviour Ontology

This chapter is aimed at describing the general model referring the occupant behaviour. In that sense and according with [(Hong et.al,2015)][@Honng2015], the occupant behaviour is composed by the following main aspects:

- **Drivers**: Represent the factors that stimulates occupants to accomplish their needs.
- **Needs**: Requirements the the different occupants shall met to ensure their satisfaction in the environment which interacts.
- **Actions**: Occupants interactions with the building to acieve the required comfort.

Considering these three main aspects, the constructed semantic model relies on the combination of the Drivers, Needs and Actions with the representation of the building infrastructure (aligning the model with the IFC) and the different observations that could occur in the building (SSN ontology).
