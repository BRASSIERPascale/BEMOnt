## Needs Specification

As briefly mentioned in the previous chapter, needs represent the requirements that has to be satisfied to ensure the occupants comfort in the building.

Within the elaborated semantic model, needs are related with the different occupant preferences considering, for each preference, maximum and minimum values. The occupant preferences refers to the level of luminosity, noise and temperature with the possibility to expand it in case of necessity. Moreover, needs also is aligned to the level pf privacy of the information and opinion of the occupants.

As an specification of the needs entity, different models and comforts perspectives will serve to model and measure the occupant satisfaction with the building conditions. In that sense, there is considered in the model the following models:

- _Thermal Comfort Model_: To measure thermal occupants needs and analyse if they are in the correspoding suitable values. For measuring thermal comfort, there will be considered the (i) ISO Adaptive Comfort; (ii) ASHRAE Adaptive Comfort; and (iii) ASHRAE Adaptive Envelope. POsibility to link other kind of models is open in the semantic modelling.
- _Visual Comfort_: Aligned with measures and models referent to visual and luminosity aspects.
- _Acoustic Comfort_: Referring the optimal noise levels in the different building zones.
- _Indoor Air Quality (IAQ)_: As a model to analyse and evaluate the indoor air quality.
