In that sense and according with (Hong et.al,2015), the occupant behaviour is composed by the following main aspects:\n\nDrivers: Represent discrete-event simulation models for modeling occupant behavior, activities, events, and equipments, considering the factors that stimulates occupants to accomplish their needs.\nNeeds: Model the requirements that the different occupants shall meet to ensure their satisfaction in the environment which interacts.\nActions: Model the occupants interactions with the building to achieve the required comfort.\n\nConsidering these three main aspects, the constructed semantic model relies on the combination of the Drivers, Needs, and Actions with the representation of the building infrastructure (aligning the model with the IFC) and the different observations that could occur in the building (SSN ontology).\nIn detail and for better comprehend the document, the semantic models selected based on their standards usage are: \n\nSemantic Sensor Network Ontology (SSN)(Compton et.al,2012): This semantic model represents sensor information and data in form of observation. Hence, this ontology permits to contextualise sensor information being also compatible with the current standards in information exchange as SensorML.\nQuantities, Units, Dimensions and Time (QUDT)(Hodgson et.al,2014): This semantic model is aimed at representing units and unit conversion for the time series and sensor outputs represented through the SSN ontology.\nW3C Time Ontology (TIME)(Cox and Little,2012): Time ontology allows to contextualise the time measurements and time instants. This aspect will serve as a complementary semantic model for the QUDT ontology regarding time measurements.\nIndustry Foundation Classes OWL (IfcOWL)(Pauwels,2017): This semantic model is used as a reference for modelling the building information and lifecycle. As a reference building for construction, this semantic model is one of the core ontologies to be linked with SSN and extended by HIT2GAP for considering user behaviour aspects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"chapter_2/OccupantSpecification.html":{"url":"chapter_2/OccupantSpecification.html","title":"Ocupant Specification","keywords":"","body":"Occupant/User Specification\nBuilding Actors (IFCActors) in the building make reference to each people that take part in the building, interacting with it through configuring the devices or event to determining the occupancy of different zones.\nConsidering this general view of the people that take part in a building, this class is represented as an entity that could act with building devices (SSN:Device) according to their role (HIT2GAP:Role). Thus, the role that an actor could take in a building is represented in form of building manager, building owner or building technician.\nA part of this, there is an specific building role that needs importance, building users. This kind of actors refers to the people who use the HIT2GAP application. Accordingly, these users are able to receive notifications for building infrastructure (e.g., Recommendations and Alerts) and gathering building status feedback. Moreover, this type of building actors also have some preference in the representation of the different HIT2GAP notifications that could be performed in form of SMS, Email, or Phone.\n\n\n\n\nOne more level of detail regarding this users refers to the definition of occupants (IfcOccupant). The occupants representation in the semantic model corresponds with the people who are moving around the building and are able to act over specific building devices in case of building policies permit the interaction.\nWithin the semantic model, building occupants have an specific attitude inside the building corresponding with the energy awareness (e.g., Energy Frugal, Energy Profilgate, Energy Indiferent). Moreover, depending on the interactions and the building type, the occupants interact with the building according to a role, as for example, a role inside a company that permit to do some action. In terms of categorising and distinguish different occupants, each of the occupants has specific characteristics. Occupants have habits and behaviour inside the building (time of start working or end working, etc).\nEach of the occupants himself has several comfort needs based on the temperature, humidity, or luminosity inside specific zones of the building, to mention a few. The needs, as we will see later in the document, will serve to associate occupant preference with the real status of the building to derive discomfort states. The interaction of occupants with the system is represented  through their actions.\n\n    \n\n"},"chapter_2/NeedsSpecification.html":{"url":"chapter_2/NeedsSpecification.html","title":"Needs Definition","keywords":"","body":"Needs Specification\nAs briefly mentioned in the previous chapter, needs represent the requirements that has to be satisfied to ensure the occupants comfort in the building.\nWithin the elaborated semantic model, needs are related with the different occupant preferences considering, for each preference, maximum and minimum values. The occupant preferences refer to the level of luminosity, noise, and temperature with the possibility to expand it in case of necessity. Moreover, the class needs also is aligned to the level of privacy of the information and opinion of the occupants.\n\n\n\n\nAs an specification of the needs entity, different models and comforts perspectives will serve to model and measure the occupant satisfaction with the building conditions. In that sense, there is considered in the model the following models:\n\nThermal Comfort Model: To measure thermal occupants needs and analyse if they are in the correspoding suitable values. For measuring thermal comfort, there will be considered the (i) ISO Adaptive Comfort; (ii) ASHRAE Adaptive Comfort; and (iii) ASHRAE Adaptive Envelope. Posibility to link other kind of models is open in the semantic modelling.\nVisual Comfort: Aligned with measures and models referent to visual and luminosity aspects.\nAcoustic Comfort: Referring the optimal noise levels in the different building zones.\nIndoor Air Quality (IAQ): As a model to analyse and evaluate the indoor air quality.\n\n"},"chapter_2/DriverSpecification.html":{"url":"chapter_2/DriverSpecification.html","title":"Drivers Definition","keywords":"","body":"Driver Specification\nDrivers represent the stimulating factors that provoke energy occupant behavior. Hence, the drivers corresponds with the measurements of building systems that interacts with the different occupants. Therefore, Drivers are the middleware between the actions and these actions are reflected in the user satisfaction (needs).\nConsidering the driver definition, the defined class is a member of observation (ssn:Obsevation). Indeed, driver class is composed by each of the observation required for simulating the user behaviour. Based on that, this class considers:\n\nBehaviour Model: As variables that serve to measure the habits and activities inside the building. Defined to register and contextualise the occupant events (building interactions with the different systems).\nActivity Model: As a class for registering the the occupants activities (relate to occupancy) inside the building.\nEvent Model: Defined to register the events that can be detected from the sensor readings.\nEquipement Model: As a class for measuring the building features and the environmental factors including indoor and outdoor parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"chapter_2/ActionSpecification.html":{"url":"chapter_2/ActionSpecification.html","title":"Actions and Building State Definition","keywords":"","body":"Action and Building State Specification\nActions are the specific building interactions performed by the building occupants. This actions can be caused by an initial discomfort or event as an occupant event. Nevertheless, the actions are connected with the drivers at time as the user changes a parameter in the building facilities. Moreover, the actions also has some influence over the needs due to this actions commonly are performed to satisfy user comfort requirements.\nIn modelling terms the actions are strongly connected with the building state. The building state allows to conextualise and determine the building facilities status. This building state determinaton has been divided into simple building states and complex building states. Simple building states correspond to the states of specific facilities or systems (cooler on/off, open/closed door, etc.). This aspects are derived in the ontology based on the analog or continuous signal of the sensors.\nIn reference to the complex states, this refers as the states that require for the combination of different facilities to determine an overall state. For example, one complex state is the determination of the energy state of the building that can be energy efficient state or energy inefficient state considering anomalous energy consumption (e.g., thermostat on at same time as the windows are open). Similarly, comfort state determination corresponds to building complex state. In that sense, occupant discomfort will occur when building do not satisfy user requirements (comparison between needs and drivers).\n\n\n\n\n\nAt time of an alert or discomfort occur, this derives in an action. The actions can be occupant events, system actions, inaction, or feedbacks. Commonly, this actions try to solve or even to modify building state. So, the elaboration of actions (or no actions) within the building could derive in newer occupant discomfort (comfort anomalies).\n \n\n \n \n"},"chapter_3/IntroductionBuildingInfrastructure.html":{"url":"chapter_3/IntroductionBuildingInfrastructure.html","title":"Building Infrastructure","keywords":"","body":"Building Infrastructure\nIntroduction to the Representation of the building infrastructure\nThe semantic representation of the building infrastructure is not a new research topic (CITES). Commonly, the semantic approaches are focused on describing the building elements (infrastructure, zones, electrical and mechanical aspects of the building). Thus, researches has trend to elaborate a version of the IFC (IFCOwl), XXXXXXXXXX. Despite the existence of numerous semantic models for modelling buildings, there is a lack of representing the information that building systems generate. Towards overcoming this lack, researches made use of temporal ontologies to represent the building information. However, considering building information as a whole (as a BBDD of all information) causes unreadability in querying the building information and the derivation of its status (CITE). Hence, some authors conclude the lack of semantics at time as dealing with temporal measurements in data-intensive environments. Nevertheless, contextualising specific building situations (specific time-windows) could be beneficial for deriving building states, recommending actions and other similar things.\nWith the aim at contextualizing building information and specific building situations for further analysis (energy anomaly detection, comfort analysis, building situations, etc), HIT2GAP project has been working on an extension of the IFCOwl ontology to cover smart devices obervation (SSN), grid contextualization (OntoMG) and geospatial capabilities (W3CGeo). Considering this aspects, the overall semantic model (see Figure below) is built using as a core the SSN ontology. Over this specific ontolology has been specified the relation between dviced for the building facilities. Major advance of HIT2GAP project over the semantic models are on the interrelation between building appliciance and their measurements, being compatible with hystack architecture and data exchange models.\n\n    \n\n\n"},"chapter_3/Observation_Measurement.html":{"url":"chapter_3/Observation_Measurement.html","title":"Building Sensor Representation","keywords":"","body":"Building Sensors Representation\nBuilding sensor are represented in the general data model (semantic model) using the ’Stimulus-Sensor-Observation‘ (SSO) (Compton et.al,2012) observation. This model (see following figure), represents the building electrical elements as a Systems, Devices or Sensors. In detail, Systems are composed by Devices (or multiple devices could take part of the same system) and indeed Sensors take part of Devices (or multiple sensors could take part of the same device).\nSensor measurements (or Observation in the model), refer to both measurements generated by building devices or by people interacting with the building (e.g. changes in temperature set-points). The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) (Botts,2013) defines the ‘Observation and Measurement’ standard model to represent sensor information. Within this model, Observations are the central element. An Observation is defined as the combination between a sensor (‘Device‘ or 'System'), their measurement (‘Phenomenon or Property‘), the specific zone or region being monitored or observed (‘Feature of Interest‘), and the specific measurement as a result of the observation (‘SensorOutput‘). This proposed model to represent the sensor time series (information) permit to contextualise all related sensor information, the type of information that is being observed as well as information regarding the sensor/device/system installed.\nTime series (specific measurements) have been represented using a combination between the classes offered by the SSN ontology and the Quantity, Units, Dimensions and Time (QUDT) ontology (Hodgson et.al,2014). SSN ontology provides the mechanisms to specify the values of the time series. As counterpart, QUDT ontology provide needed mechanisms for representing specific measures and data conversions.\nTime intervals and temporal parameters of the observations and time series have been represented using W3C-Time ontology (Hobbs & Pan,2004). This semantic model facilitates the representation, abstraction and conversion of temporal measurements. In detail, we have been used the \"Instant\" and \"DateTimeInterval\" to enable an observation to represent single value at certain time or to represent multiple values (time series) during certain period of time.\nThus, this way to represent semantically the sensor information facilitates data integration over different building data sources, fuse the information according for example their measurements and enable data provenance of the information based on describing sensor information (type of sensor, measurements, throughput, etc).\n\n    \n\n\nConsidering this core-semantic and standard modelling of sensors based on the SSN ontology, the proposed HIT2GAP semantic model extends this classes by adapting it to the building domain. In detail, the main work performed has been focused on defining the different Features of Interest regarding building (represent zones, building layers, etc), describe the different phenomenoms and add geo-spatial capabilities adapting to the building and energy domain needs.\n"},"chapter_3/geo.html":{"url":"chapter_3/geo.html","title":"Geo-spatial Building Representation","keywords":"","body":"Geo-Spatial Representation of the Building Elements\nThe representation of geo-spatial information in the presented ontology is incorporated through the W3C Geo ontology (Hobbs & Pan,2006). This semantic model permit to enable the geo-spatial reasoning over the building information. In fact, this semantic model permit to locate the building, the specific building zones and the placement of the sensors and systems of the building.\nFor that (see following figure), the W3CGeo ontology are linked with the SSN ontology. The way to link both ontologies have been through the hierarchy linkage between the SSN entities prone to have geo-spatial capabilities and the \"_Feature\" entity of the geo-spatial model. Thus, the SSN entities prone to geo-spatial capabilities are the \"System\" and \"FeatureOfInterest\". All classes \"child\" from \"_Feature\" class of W3C Geo ontology are geo-spatially represented by \"Points\" or \"Polygons\" using their link (\"where\" link) with the Geometry class.\n  \n      \n  \n\nMoreover, we have add some more information referring the geo-spatial information of the building. This information refers to the hemisphere where the building is located and the climate region where the building is placed. These added information permit us to be compatible with the architecture for building domain known as Haystack (Haystack,2017).\nTherefore, considering geo-spatial information in the semantic model and making compatible the semantic model with Haystack geospatial information facilitate data integration from this kind of architectures and syntactic data models.\n"},"chapter_3/FeaturesInterest.html":{"url":"chapter_3/FeaturesInterest.html","title":"Building Domain Feature of Interest","keywords":"","body":"Building Domain Feature of Interest\nAs mentioned in previous sections, Feature of interest are real world representation of the building. This real world representation of the building comprise building infrastructure and the corresponding building elements (mechanical and electrical elements, furniture, etc).\nTo adapt the SSN ontology to the building domain, the Industry Foundation Class (IFC)(Pauwels & Terkaj, 2016) has been incorporated. This semantic model permit to link the proposed ontology with the Building Information Model (BIM) notation (Volk et.al, 2014).\nConsidering this aspects, the feature of interest class of SSN has be linked (hierarchy) with the IfcBuilding, IfcBuildingElement, and BuildingAppliance. The IfcBuilding class defines the building infrastructure to consider in the data model. Each building pertains to an specific type (\"hasType\" semantic relation) as agricultural, commercial, residential, etc. Considering their infrastructure, each building contains several real work zones (IfcZones). This zones can be rooms, floors, desk, etc. Moreover, the building contains some abstracted vision of the building (e.g mechanical view, electric view, thermal view, etc).\n Over this abstracted views, the different building elements are represented. This building elements contains building systems (\"Flow Instruments\", \"ProtectiveDevices\", \"Unitary Control Elements\"). But also, this specific abstracted views could contain sensors and building appliance for monitoring and control of the building, incorporate occupants devices and the incorporation of building specific sensors.\n\n      \n  \n\nIn case of the Building Appliances, several devices and IFC specific devices has been categorised and included:\n\n      \n  \n\n\nAs a conclusion of the section, the features of interest representation of the building are performed using standard building modelling (IFC and BIM). Moreover, the proposed ontology ensures the information compatibility and sharing with these models.
