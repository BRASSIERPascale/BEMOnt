# HIT2GAPOnt: A semantic model to represent building infrastructure and occupants interactions

## Introduction

Hit2Gap Ontology is focused on establishing a common data model and semantic knowledge management for buildings and their sensor networks, including their interaction with the occupants. With this aim, the proposed ontology will take into consideration the following aspects:

- **Building infrastructure data models and semantic representation**: as mechanims to represent the different systems and infrastructure involved in Building Information Modelling (BIM) and required for the performance of the project tools (building simulation tools, building monitoring tools, visualization tools, etc.).

- **Sensor data and sensor network infrastructure models and semantic representation**: as a mechanism to represent sensor data and sensor network infrastructures that are supported in the BIM.

- **User Behaviour data models and semantic representation**: this part of the ontology is aimed at representing building occupants DNA (Drivers, Needs, and Actions). This type of modelling will serve to represent the user-building interaction not only in form of activities but also considering comfort parameters and other aspects that motivate users to perform building actions.

Therefore and since semantic representation, HIT2GAP project will harmonise all inforamtion related to buildings monitoring and control activities (management activities), considering the user as an important aspect to adjust energy according to their preferences.
