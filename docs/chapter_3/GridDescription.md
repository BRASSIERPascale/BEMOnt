# Building Grid Description

Interesting aspect of the proposed semantic model is the representation of the different grids and the energy flows. Hence, this flows representation is based on the Onto-MG model [(Salameh et.al,2015)][@Salameh2015]. In this kind of modelling, the grid (micro-grid) is based on several branches that link the building infrastructure with the generated building renewable flows, non-renewable flows and the different building systems linked with that flows.
