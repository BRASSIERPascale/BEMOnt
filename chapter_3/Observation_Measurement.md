# Building Sensors Representation

Building sensor are represented in the general data model (semantic model) using the ’Stimulus-Sensor-Observation‘ (SSO) [(Compton et.al,2012)][@Compton2012] observation. This model (see following figure), represents the building electrical elements as a Systems, Devices or Sensors. In detail, Systems are composed by Devices (or multiple devices could take part of the same system) and indeed Sensors take part of Devices (or multiple sensors could take part of the same device).

Sensor measurements (or Observation in the model), refer to both measurements generated by building devices or by people interacting with the building (e.g. changes in temperature set-points). The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) [(Botts,2013)][@Botts2013] defines the ‘Observation and Measurement’ standard model to represent sensor information. Within this model, Observations are the central element. An Observation is defined as the combination between a sensor (‘Device‘ or 'System'), their measurement (‘Phenomenon or Property‘), the specific zone or region being monitored or observed (‘Feature of Interest‘), and the specific measurement as a result of the observation (‘SensorOutput‘). This proposed model to represent the sensor time series (information) permit to contextualise all related sensor information, the type of information that is being observed as well as information regarding the sensor/device/system installed.

Time series (specific measurements) have been represented using a combination between the classes offered by the SSN ontology and the Quantity, Units, Dimensions and Time (QUDT) ontology [(Hodgson et.al,2014)][@Hodgson2014]. SSN ontology provides the mechanisms to specify the values of the time series. As counterpart, QUDT ontology provide needed mechanisms for representing specific measures and data conversions.

Time intervals and temporal parameters of the observations and time series have been represented using W3C-Time ontology [(Hobbs & Pan,2004)][@Hobbs2014]. This semantic model facilitates the representation, abstraction and conversion of temporal measurements. In detail, we have been used the "Instant" and "DateTimeInterval" to enable an observation to represent single value at certain time or to represent multiple values (time series) during certain period of time.

Thus, this way to represent semantically the sensor information facilitates data integration over different building data sources, fuse the information according for example their measurements and enable data provenance of the information based on describing sensor information (type of sensor, measurements, throughput, etc).

Considering this core-semantic and standard modelling of sensors based on the SSN ontology, the proposed HIT2GAP semantic model extends this classes by adapting it to the building domain. In detail, the main work performed has been focused on defining the different Features of Interest regarding building (represent zones, building layers, etc), describe the different phenomenoms and add geo-spatial capabilities adapting to the building and energy domain needs.
