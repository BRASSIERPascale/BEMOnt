# Building Phenomenoms

Complementing the sensor representation of the building devices and infrastructure, the phenomenon (property) representation of the provide a common vision about the general properties to be considered in the building. Thus, one of the extensions of the ontology appears in the ’SSN:Property‘ representation. Under this specific class of the SSN ontology has been added economic and physic properties.

## Economic Properties

The Economic phenomena makes reference to all monetary and investment aspects that could affect the building domains. For example, this part of the ontology is capable of representing water-related tariffs, energy bills, building investments, etc. This specific phenomena has been subdivided into: (i) ’Costs‘ to capture the investment costs of the building; and (ii) "Investment" to represent the building investment aspects and information.

## Physic Properties

This phenomenon represents all related physical aspects that an observation could observe. This physical aspects  corresponds to dimensional, volumetric and radiation aspects that influence on the building and occupant behaviour.
This phenomenon supports the alignment and fusion of specific observations based on general measurements (e.g. temperature, volume, etc.).
